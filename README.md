🗝 Escape Room - Python for Beginners

✏ Elaine Chan &copy; 2022

## Task:

A marathon runner was on their daily run when they encountered a Python. Help them escape by figuring out the shortest distance they can take out of 4 paths. You are to implement the concept of recursion to find out which path is the shortest by adding up all the distances in the list. You are not allowed to modify any of the existing code. You are only allowed to add to it.

## Exceptions and Constraints:

- Recursion must be implemented
- Existing code is not allowed to be modified, you are only allowed to add onto the `add_distances()` and `find_shortest()` functions

## Expected Output:
```
Path 4
```
